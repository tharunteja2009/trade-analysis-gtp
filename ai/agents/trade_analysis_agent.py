   - Real-time stock price & charts (NSE/BSE).

   - Quarterly results & financial statements.  
   - Cash flow details (operating, investing, financing cash flows).  
   - Earnings call transcripts & management commentary (future growth guidance, demand outlook, capex).  
   - Recent news & sentiment (positive/negative tone, market rumors, global sector trends).  
   - Regulatory / policy updates (SEBI, RBI, government reforms, legal challenges).  
   - Analyst ratings & institutional flows (FII/DII activity).

4. Decision Logic:  
   - If fundamentals + growth guidance are strong, but news/regulatory risk is negative → HOLD or SELL until clarity.  
   - If fundamentals are weak but management projects strong recovery → speculative BUY/HOLD depending on sentiment.  
   - If both fundamentals & sentiment are negative → SELL.  
   - If fundamentals are solid, cash flow strong, sentiment positive → BUY.  
   - If fundamentals are solid, cash flow strong, sentiment positive + growth guidance are strong → MUST BUY.
